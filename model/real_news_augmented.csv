"Last week, President Obama offered an animated defense of the values ​​of his party - in fact, of the inheritance of the New Deal and the Great Society. Immediately afterwards, as still happens when the Democrats take up position, the Civility Police came out in force. The president, we were told, was too partisan; He needs to treat his opponents with respect; He should have lunch with them and find a consensus.

This is a bad idea. Just as important, it is an undemocratic idea.

Let's review the story so far.

Two weeks ago, the Republicans of the Chamber published their proposal for a big budget, selling it to gullible experts as a declaration of necessity, and not of ideology - a document telling America what must be done.

But it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document that you might have guessed from the opening sentence: ""Where the president failed, the republicans of the chamber will direct."" It has aroused the danger of deficits, but even in itself (not at all credible), discounts of expenditure has been used mainly to pay tax reductions rather than a reduction in the deficit. The transparent and obvious objective was to use fears by deficit to impose a vision of the small government and low taxes, in particular the rich.

The budget proposal for the Chamber therefore revealed a yawning gap between the priorities of the two parties. And that revealed a profound difference in views of the functioning of the world.",1

Smith also opened its doors as a gay, saying: ""By thinking about it, it was the fear of saying the bad thing and the offensive ... and I was 19 when I started writing the first album.

"Of all the main Republicans, the one that comes closest to my world vision is Newt Gingrich. Despite his opinions of erratically change and his strange phases, he continually returns to this basic political refrain: he speaks of the use of the government in an energetic but limited manner to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility.

As he said in 2007, ""this is not a point of view that libertarians would adopt, but I am more in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need a government to help stimulate private and economic development.""

Look at American history, Gingrich continued: “The government provided subsidies to railland to encourage a generalized adoption of what was then the most modern form of transport to develop our country. The Homestead ownership act essentially gave land to those who have to live on it and develop it. bureaucracies funded by taxpayers. »»

It was not one of Gingrich's passing methods. This is one of the most coherent themes of his career. His 1984 book, ""Window of Opportunity"", is a large side of what he calls the conservatism of ""leave -faire"" - the idea that the government should simply deviate so that the market can flourish. As he wrote, ""the opportunity that society does not call a society of a leave in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but of an energetic government intervention in the name of growth and opportunities.""",1

Aaron Carter came to doctors in the hope of solving his many health problems. After his arrest in July Dui and the duration of the painful newspapers that questioned the state of his health, the singer contributed to the show to obtain help.

""I think that Aaron is here today for a reason. He hopes to feel better in his life, his health,"" said Dr. Travis Stork's doctor.

The singer reveals that he was the subject of a repeated shame of the body with certain people saying that he seems to have cancer or AIDS and some wonder if he uses hard medications. Regarding his little stature and his weight, he said to us: ""Why am I so thin?"" Acid reflux, [and a] hiatal hernia. ""

""I don't care a lot about my appearance ... because I'm emaciated and I'm thin,"" he said to Dr. Rodriguez. ""I am concerned about my overall health because people tell me that I seem to have aid or I seem to have cancer, or I seem to die.""

When he asked him questions about drug use, he said: """" I don't do cocaine, I don't do a methamphetamine, everyone always calls me a crack head and a methamphetamine head, whether it be media, blogs, they are ashamed of the body every day. He continues by revealing: ""I have never smoked crack in my life, I have never smoked methamphetamine of my life. I tried cocaine when I was 16."" Aaron is prescribed a variety of drugs by his doctor, notably Xanax, Klonopin, Oxycodone to treat his fractured jaw, his fractured ball and his pain associated with its rigorous performance routines.

The star also shares: ""I have not always been the sexier sexually"" and is concerned about the possibility of having an STD as well as anxiety and stress.

Aaron said to doctors: ""I take my medication if necessary…. Do I have to have the control of [my prescription drugs]? Absolutely, I do it. It is in moderation, it is as much as necessary. It is not to become high.""

The combination of taking benzodiazepines and opiates, which can lead to accidental death, is worrying to doctors and psychiatrists, Dr. Domenick Sportilli, who was also brought to work with the singer.

""When you are an anxious person, you drive an excess speed out of control, totally out of control. I give you a benzo, it's like letting you brake this car for a little while, but in a few hours, this car will be out of control,"" explains Dr. Sportelli. ""You have to learn to drive the car.

"Hanabusa leads a case with almost all the votes counted

By B.J. Reyes

Posted: 2:40 p.m. HST, May 22, 2010

The Republican Charles Djou came out victorious this evening during the special elections to fill the post of Hawaii at the Congress, giving Hawaii his first member of the GOP Congress in 20 years.

Djou won the special postal election with 39.7% of the votes during the final printing, published at 9 p.m.

The final printing represented 171,417 voting bulletins returned by voters in the district, which extends from Waikiki and downtown to Mililani.

Democrat Colleen Hanabusa finished second with 31%, with a third -time democratic case at 27.8%.

""It's an important day,"" said Djou to a jubilant crowd at the headquarters of the State Festival. “We sent a message to the US Congress. We sent a message to the ex-government. We sent a message to the national democrats! We sent a message to the machine.

""We have told them that we will not remain dotted because our great nation is overloaded by too many taxes, too many debts and too many unnecessary expenses.""

Djou is the first member of the Hawaii GOP Congress since Pat Saiki, who represented the party from 1987 to 1991.

2010 Special elections The party of candidates Vote for percentage r Charles Djou 67 61 39.7% D Colleen Hanabusa 52,802 31.0% D Case 47 391 27.8% D Rafael del Castillo 664 0.4% n Kalaelo Strode 491 0.3% R Charles Charles Carruls 194 0.2% D Philmund Lae C.

Source: Hawaii election office

Eleven other candidates combined to receive 2.1% of the vote.

The former representative of the United States, Neil Abercrombie, announced in December that planned to resign from his seat to focus only on his campaign for the governor, triggering a special election campaign not like everything in state history.

As he officially resigned on February 28, the field of three main contenders had formed and the election office - after considering openly whether to postpone the vote to the September primary to save money - settled on a postal process at the price of around $ 1 million.

A Star-Bulletin / Kitv survey in January gave the case, the former member of the 2nd district congress, the edge of the recognition and the favor of the name, followed by Hanabusa, president of the State Senate, then Djou, municipal councilor.

The race was on the radar of national parties and political experts, but many expected that the siege remains democratic in a district which argued that Obama argued by 72%.

The sensitivities changed in January after the Republican Scott Brown overturned the siege formerly belonging to the Democrat Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts.

Suddenly, the national eyes were on Hawaii while the GOP was looking for the ""Next Scott Brown"", and a chance to mark an upheaval on Obama's home lawyer before the fall half-past elections.

The money flocked - more than a million dollars each for Djou and Hanabusa - while the Republicans hoped to capitalize on the winning nature of the special election and ""take the gap"" in the middle of a split democratic electorate.

Party divisions have deepened after the American senator Dan Inouye, still bitter about the US Senator Dan Akaka in 2006, threw his considerable support in Hanabusa.

Its influence and support prevented the campaign committee of the Democrat Congress from making an approval in the race. The committee would have asked to support the case as the most viable candidate.

After spending $ 300,000 in advertisements attacking Djou, the committee withdrew from Hawaii earlier this month, citing the inability of the local party to come together behind a single candidate.",1
"Washington - President Donald Trump weighed on the Emmys, who were heavy on humor and scales at his expense.

""I was saddened to see how bad the notes on the Emmy last night-the worst of all time. The most intelligent people of all are the"" deplorable "", he wrote Tuesday evening, two days after the television of the Emmy Awards on Sunday. The president is in New York, staying in Trump Tower, during the United Nations General Assembly.

I was saddened to see how bad the notes on the Emmy last night - the worst of all time. The most intelligent people of all are the ""deplorable"". - Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) September 20, 2017

The EMMYS, broadcast by CBS, were roughly tied with last year's ceremony in terms of total viewers. The Sunday award ceremony was on average 11.4 million viewers, compared to 11.3 million in 2016, its lowest of all time. Television also obtained an average score of 2.5 in adults 18-49, falling below the low point of 2.8 of last year.

Animator Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue distorting Trump's own fixation with EMMYS, including his past tweets who have disrected the prices awarded by the television academy after having managed to win Emmy trophies for ""The Apprentice"". In a 2013 tweet, Trump quoted political prejudices for his lack of victories at the Emmy.

However, she praised Sean Spicer for his Emmy Cameo, in which he laughed at his own post-abundage press conference in which he reprimanded the media never his report on the size of Trump's inaugural crowd. The appearance of Spicer pulled a reaction from the Trump detractors who criticized Colbert and the producers of Emmy for having treated the laughs of a political agent who had been a champion of the Trump's polarizing day.

""This is something that people in Hollywood often miss - which is introspection and good humor,"" said Conway about Spicer.

But he joked the fact that they will not get married during the same ceremony because ""I don't want her and Sasha to spread me in my first dance with Linda.""

"Super bowl viewers were shocked when Netflix abandoned an announcement for the paradox of Cloverfield, revealing that the J.J. The film produced by Abrams so far known as God left would give up a theatrical version and make its debut in the streaming service immediately after the big match on Sunday.

The marketing stuntman has crowned a rescue plan hatched by Abrams, the president of Paramount-C-CEG Jim Gianopulos, the chief of Netflix Ted Sarandos and the chief of the original films Scott Stuber, among others.

Worried that Cloverfield Paradox perishes at the box office - he had to strike the rooms on April 20 after several delays - Paramount and Abrams gave it to Netflix, which is willing to pay large dollars for very publicized content.

The agreement, discussed during the holidays and finalized in January, is worth the north of $ 50 million, according to sources in Hollywood Reporter, with paramount conservation rights for China and home entertainment.

This makes the film instantly profitable for the studio, which avoids a (probably) missed and an expensive marketing campaign. And Netflix obtained what he was looking for, regardless of wilt criticism (18% on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of the press): Buzz.

""This attracts attention and captures a certain vision of the beat,"" explains Paul Verna from Emarketer. And even if the streamer does not finally get the audience, he hoped for paradox, ""they always have a brand shock,"" he adds.

Cloverfield Paradox, which finished the main photography in September 2016, was part of the successful and popular series of Cloverfield, but sources say that Gianopulos, who joined Paramount six months later, was worried.

Despite additions to clarify the beats of characters and link the film to the universe of the franchise, it was finally deemed unhealthy, even with a cast led by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Elizabeth Debicki, David Oyelowo and Daniel Bruhl.

Netflix was an obvious destination, having already resumed international rights on the annihilation of Natalie Portman Starrer, which Paramount will publish at the national level on February 23.

Paramount retains rights over future Cloverfield payments. Overlord, a Zombie Film of the Second World War of Abrams which obtained a high score in two recent test projections, could be a competitor, although sources say that his fate is still indefinite.

Olivia Culpo was a fan of New England patriots long before meeting and fell in love with Danny Amendola, so maybe the death of death sounded on their relationship when he joined the Miami Dolphins rival. Everyone of a certain age that grew up in New England had a father or an uncle with a ""Squish the Fish"" t-shirt from 1986-and it can be difficult to shake up these cultural ties.

"Caitlyn Jenner overturns tea on Kylie Jenner's difficulty telling her that she was pregnant ... And honestly, her comments were a little shady.

The Kardashian family revealed who delivered Kylie Jenner's daughter, Stormi, when she was born - and it was not the doctor.

In an overview of the latest episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, ""Momager"" Kris Jenner reveals that it was she who delivered her daughter's baby.

Jenner sprang with her 21 -year -old child, saying that she was ""such a soldier"" thanks to her delivery.

""She was really. She was so calm,"" said the mother of five about Kylie, who shares Stormi with rapper Travis Scott. ""It was really exciting,"" she said before adding, ""I delivered the baby! I delivered it. I removed it.""

The famous matriarch also shared that, unlike most about to give birth, Kylie did not feel much pain.

Jenner said: ""She kept saying:"" I don't feel any pain ""and you would see the contractions like crazy and she would say:"" I just don't feel it "", and I would say:"" It's really weird. """"

People magazine pointed out for the first time Jenner's GrossaNcy News in September 2017, but the young star of reality personally confirmed them only after giving birth.

Kylie shared an Instagram publication with fans as well as a 10 -minute video of her pregnancy trip on YouTube.

""I knew for myself that I had to prepare for this role of life in the most positive way, without stress and healthy that I knew how,"" she said. “There was no Gotcha time, no big remuneration that I had planned. I knew that my baby would feel each stress and each emotion, so I chose to do it in this way for my little life and our happiness. ”

But Kylie is not the only sister to have a unique baby delivery.

In 2009, when the older sister Kourtney gave birth to her first child with ex-little friend Scott Disick, Mason, the star withdrew her own baby during childbirth.

In a 2016 interview with Today Extra, she revealed that it was her boyfriend from the Disick era who filmed the birth that had been broadcast in the family reality show.

""Scott filmed it for our own ends, as for a home film,"" said Kourtney. “The birth of my son was such a beautiful experience that I really wanted to share it with people because it was my child. I remember having been so terrified to give birth because you see in the films that everyone shouts and it was so crazy and my experience was incredible. I just felt something in me wanted to share this with people. ”

The sister of the Khloe community, who recently gave birth to her first child, often makes fun of the epic childbirth of her sister.

During the second birth of Kourtney against her daughter, Penelope, Khloe joked saying that her sister ""takes out her own children"".

Kris Jenner is now a grandmother of nine grandchildren.

The filter, in addition to imposing a flower nestled behind the right ear of True, also modifies the shape of the face, the color of the eyes, the eyelashes and the complexion, creating the effect of a handful of freckles perfectly distributed on the cheeks and the nose.

Although the message was flooded with likes and sweet comments of the fans, the filter also created confusion because many have started to debate and speculate on really true features.

""Does the baby have freckles or is it the filter?"" asked the user @ coldoughtkeenqueen4life.

""What is the silly filter?"" asked the user @ luca9557.

""Does the baby really need a filter?"" said user @ 2blackheart. ""This image is so misleading.""

""Stop with the filters,"" said the user @ kdotl22. ""We can't even say its real color.""

""Love it! Adorable! Congratulations @Khloekardashian,"" wrote the user @ umnms.leafe. ""But too funny to present a baby in speech with a filter on them. But it's the Kardashian way, to cover yourself ... But seriously, it is precious and perfect.""

A source told people that the fact that the three mothers have recently chosen to use a filter on their little one is not a coincidence. The source says that it is a conscious decision taken for confidentiality - the stars think they protect their babies if they do not show their full face.

During the 10th anniversary special of their show last year, the family opened to allow their loved ones and children to appear in front of the camera, with Kourtney Kardashian, 39, noting that ""the limits are still changing"".

""We will certainly go through moments when we say,"" cut the children back "","" she said.

""Mason calls [the crew] the filmmakers,"" said Kourtney. ""He said to himself:"" Do filmmakers arrive? I want to show them my legos that I build. ""Now he is in a phase where he says to himself:"" I don't like when the filmmakers are finished. """"

For his part, Kim said that the appearance on Kuwtk is ""a personal choice"".

""You can fall in love with someone, and it's not their work to be in our show,"" she said. ""Kanye [West] respects what I do and sometimes it is on, if it happens to be there, or will let us film if we are at a concert. The children have not done so.",1

"Press release Sanders supports the bill on firearm security January 16, 2016 Twitter

Facebook

Email jersey

Charleston, S.C. - The American senator Bernie Sanders made his promise to support the legislation on Saturday to modify a 2005 law on the responsibility of firearms manufacturers.

""I am happy that this legislation is presented,"" said Sanders about the proposals of Senator Richard Blumenthal and the Representative Adam Schiff to cancel parties of a law granting a large immunity of prosecution to the manufacturers of firearms and dealers. ""As I have said for several months now, we have to examine the underlying law and tighten it,"" added Sanders.

Sanders called the ""good news"" that the bills of the Senate and the Chamber offered by Blumenthal and Schiff would leave in place of the provisions in the 2005 law which require children's safety locks on firearms and armor drilling ammunition. ""These are important provisions that I have argued,"" he said.

Sanders has also renewed its concern that the law should not submit owners of small firearms stores, who have not acted in negligence, to prosecution. ""As I said, I want to make sure that this legislation does not have a negative impact on small firearms in rural America which serve the hunting community. I am therefore delighted to support legislation and if it is in consideration, I would work to make sure that it understands a provision which allows us to monitor its impact so that we can determine if they have uninformed consequences.""

Sanders proposed a change in Blumenthal and Schiff bills would force the Commerce Department to monitor and report the impact of the law on rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by significant local arms stores. Amendment Sanders would add this article to the proposed legislation:

Second. 3. Protection of rural mom stores and significant pop hunting. The Secretary of Commerce monitors the impact of this law, if necessary, on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, in rural communities of significant local sellers. Within six months of promotion and every six months later, the secretary transmits the results of the follow-up to the judicial power of the House of Representatives of the United States and the US Senate, respectively.",1

"""I am a good guy who made a bad decision,"" admitted Logan Paul on Thursday during his first public interview since he published a video in the so-called Japan suicide forest which generated an important reaction.

The actor and the star of YouTube sat with Michael Strahan of Good Morning America for a large -scale interview on his decision at the end of December to publish a video showing a victim of suicide. After being criticized for the position, he published two apologies before taking a step back from his public figure. Last week, he published his first video in almost a month and used it to talk about suicide prevention.

""The idea was to make another fun blog, to go camp for a night and to make another entertaining content in a forest,"" Paul told Strahan. ""Things have obviously changed fairly radical and fast.""

The original video of Paul's December 31, which he shot in one day, scrambled the face of the victim of suicide that he and his friends found in the woods. But many people have pushed back how he reacted to the discovery and his decision to finally publish the video. ""I think it happened for a reason,"" said Paul in the interview broadcast on Thursday. ""I think that this reason is so that I can take this experience, learn from it, disseminate the message - in the right way - from suicide prevention and consciousness of suicide prevention.""

Paul also revealed that he received death threats. ""It's difficult because, ironically, I am told to commit suicide myself,"" he said. ""Millions of people literally tell me that they hate me, to go die in a fire.""

When Strahan asked if Paul had the impression that the criticism had been fair, he replied: ""It's the thing. I do it.""

Although Paul fans - he has 16 million YouTube subscribers - has largely supported him in the last month, many members of the YouTube community have spoken against him. And Youtube finally decided to withdraw Paul from his premium advertising program, Google preferred. He also indefinitely suspended his projects with Paul, including a series of his Hit Youtube Red Movie The Finning and said that he will not appear in the new season of the Comedy Foursome series. The leaders said they would give him the opportunity to learn from his mistakes.

""I understand that they had to take a stand,"" said Paul about Youtube's actions. ""Although I don't necessarily agree with this, I respect it.""

Strahan asked if the decision had harmed Paul financially. ""You want to know the real answer? It hurts, but it's not like I was drowning,"" he said. ""I try not to live my life thinking about money, because money does not make me happy. Creating and making others happy makes me happy.""",1

Since Alex and J.Lo did not grow very rich, they do not want to spoil their children by giving them everything they have never had as children. Alex said that since his two daughters, Natasha, 14, and Ella, 10, know the importance of restoring during the holidays, ""they do not ask too much,"" he said.

"Following a court decision which granted him the joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter Shayla with the ex-wife Norma, Tyrese Gibson is expressed now and calls for the decision of ""victory"" for his only child.

By taking on Instagram on Saturday, the fast and furious actor shared several snapshots of him and his daughter, writing how the decision was ""not a victory for me"", but rather ""for our daughter, Shayla"".

Videos of Popculture.com

""[She] was exposed to tensions, to private and public embarrassment and to grow and to feel torn between 2 parents who are no longer married,"" wrote Gibson.

""It is a victory because it spends time with her two parents in joint police custody while she continues to develop in a happy and healthy environment-it has always been and will continue to be my priority,"" he said.

Gibson continues by sharing that he has been ""the best father"" in the past 10 years and while facing ""false accusations"" by Norma, he was ""pushed into unexpected social media storms while trying to fight for my career and stay financially afloat"".

For weeks, Gibson and his ex-norma wife were catapulted under the spotlight, with the young Shayla watching. On Friday, a norma request for a ban on prohibition against Gibson was refused, according to the explosion.

The judge judged that there was no model of harassment in progress by Gibson against Norma. Subsequently, the judge released the courtroom so that the parties could discuss the daughter of the pair, Shayla.

In October, Gibson was under investigation by the Los Angeles Children's Department and Family Services, but the case was Cloeed without charging.",1
"The episode of Tuesday by American Horror Story: Cult, which was to present a scene in which a mass shoot occurred, was published to be less graphic after the Las Vegas mortal shooting in which 58 people were killed and hundreds of more injured.

Ryan Murphy, co-creator and showrunner of anthology FX Horror, first made the comments on Saturday during a discussion of the New Yorker Festival. The scene in question was filmed before the shooting of Las Vegas, Murphy explaining that they have shot the sequence in September even if they are still running this season (several of the actors have already been wrapped). ""I just made the decision that I will have all this violence to be shown most of the camera,"" he said about the edition of the episode after the box and locked before the tragedy in Vegas.

Monday, FX confirmed that the episode would see ""substantial"" changes for Tuesday television, but that the original unpublished episode would then be published on the VOD and streaming platforms.

""In the light of the tragedy last week in Las Vegas, Ryan Murphy and the producers of American Horror Story: Cult chose to make substantial modifications to the opening scene of the episode of [Tuesday],"" FX said in a statement. ""This opening, which was filmed two months ago and which depicts an occurrence of armed violence which unfortunately has become too common in our country, contains a sequence that certain viewers could find traumatic.""

The network indicates that the published episode will be broadcast on the FX Linear channel, while the unpublished and original version will be available on the VOD platform of cable, satellite or telecommunications providers, as well as on the non-linear platforms FX Networks, FXNOW and FX +.

Speaking of the decision on Saturday with television criticism New Yorker Emily Nussbaum, Murphy said that he felt ""responsibility"" towards the victims of armed violence.

""No one never talks about the rights of the victims. It is sort of a strange emotional discussion that has never been filled,"" added Murphy. ""But I felt a great sympathy for people affected, certainly, and family members and relatives and people who are upset by the way the world is.""

Murphy explained that there was a conversation on what to do with the Ahs episode following the shooting: ""Should you ventilate it? Shouldn't you ventilate it? How are you sensitive?""

""My point of view was that I believe that I have the right to ventilate it, but I also believe in the rights of the victims, and I believe that now it is probably not the week to have something explosive or incendiary in culture because someone who was affected could look at that and it could trigger something or make it upset. Our decision was to reissue it and I thought it was the right movement,"" he said.

The scene was graphic, said Murphy, in order to make ""an obvious anti-army warning on society"".

The seventh season of The Horror Anthology Show, which features Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters, follows the rise of a cult led by the fictitious character of Peters. The post-electoral game season explores how someone can get up in a private community of their rights. Throughout the season, Peters will embody five other real notorious heads, from Charles Manson to David Koresh.

This is not the first time that a show had to change a scene or delay the visualization of an episode in response to events in the real world. Mr. Robot of the United States delayed his final of season 1, who presented a character who killed himself on television, similar to the filming events of Virginia TV in which a journalist was killed on the air.

Likewise, the United States delayed the first of its star shooter Ryan Phillippe following a deadly demonstration by Black Lives Matter in Dallas where an attack on a sniper of a military veterinarian in disgrace killed five police officers.

Murphy's comments were part of a vast discussion of his career and many television series, past, present and future. He revealed the fate of the cult episode as part of a answer to a question from Nussbaum on people offended by things in his shows and what offends him.

"The labor market is the basis of income for almost all families of working age, so when the labor market is deteriorating, household income drops.

As the figure shows, the income for median household of the opening age - where the holder of the house is less than 65 years - was dropped by $ 4,184 between 2007 and 2010. In addition, the great recession came on the heels of one of the worst commercial cycles (2000-2007) in terms of job creation, in which the median age of working age fell.

Thus, typical working age has brought about $ 6,300 less in 2010 than in 2000, a drop of more than 10%. A lost decade, indeed.

"In the show, however, June is so special that her eyebrow could as well be on the currency of the revolution. Her husband confronts her kidnapper in Canada. She gives her own baby. Even if people have died to help her escape at the start of the season, she is now determined to stay in Gilead, because I guess season 3 must be something. A reading is that there is no exhaust of the suffocation of a submission regime. Except in the show, there is actually the exhaust - and yet June decided not to do it.

Season 2 was conscientiously brutal, with many tortures, rapes, executions and murders. He gave in to each of the most tedious instincts in the series, substituting slow looks and endless assembly sequences for any real or new interiority. Each thumb of existence is horrible. Cookies are non -edible. Oprah is in exile. We are at the north pole of misery and we are told to walk north.

Thus, all that the spectacle can do is walk in circles. The primitive injury of June is separated from his daughter Hannah. This cannot be reinforced, so instead, season 2 repeats it. This could also seem strangely resonant, given the human rights crisis on the Mexican border which saw the immigrant children separated from their parents. But not entirely, because an essential flash point in current America ""The Handmaid’s Tale"" ignores is race and ethnicity. Our United States certainly does not do it.

The trauma of June is repeated, just like everyone else. June Emily's friend (Alexis Bledel), who was punished last season by cutting his clitoris, was sent to the gulag, just like Janine (Madeline Brewer), who had her eye removed. After working for a few episodes, he was back in Gilead for them both - back to disjointed travel on the market and conspiracy whispers. Would Nick’s Child bride ruin everything? No; It was executed, then everything was back in bad normal.",1
"Will & Grace finally declared official goodbye to the character of Shelley Morrison Rosario on Thursday evening. Although the actress is still alive, she retired from the company - the creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan therefore could not include it in the NBC renewal series. But they always felt forced to give the beloved character a farewell to his stature in the show. As Karen said in his praise Thursday evening, Rosario spent eight seasons being much more than a maid. She was Karen's ""combat partner"", her ""best friend"", her ""everything"".

Until Thursday, the show had written around the absence of Rosario, but now, it's permanent. Rosario collapses at Karen and died of complications during surgery. Karen decides to make Rosario la Quinceañera funeral that she never had in adolescence, but is too surmounted by sorrow to present herself to the event until the end, when the room is empty. The episode once again welcomed the frequent bartender of Karen, Smitty (played by several actors during the original series), and Lorraine Finster by Minnie Driver, alias Mistress OneTime to Karen's husband. And there was a final revelation, which, according to the creators and runners of the show, will be addressed this year in more detail: Grace's mother, Bobbi, played in the original series of Debbie Reynolds, also died between the original series and the recovery. (Reynolds herself died in December 2016.)

""The character felt too much of the fabric of the show to reject him with a line or two or an explanation,"" Kohan told Variety, speaking of Rosario. ""I felt like it deserved a loving farewell more.""

So Will & Grace scripted Rosario an appropriate shipment, with Kohan and Mutchnick making only one modification to the original funerary monologue of writers for Megan Mullally: they deleted all the jokes.

""You cannot be as funny as Megan Mullally without having the opposite capacity, and that's just something you know if you work with actors who are very good: the best can easily do both,"" said Mutchnick. ""And Megan is just someone who displayed this side. But as soon as we knew that we had the chance to do something heavy, we knew that we had the actress who could deliver the most dramatic episode we have ever done.""

The spectors of the show told Variety that even during his first cold reading, Mullally led them to tears. The same thing happened during rehearsal and during shooting.

Seeing Karen becoming serious has given additional nuances to the character, a woman whose bravado generally masks her vulnerability. Thursday evening, her emotions were fully exposed, even when she used a cleaning spray of the interior of the Rosario coffin to blur a place on the coffin and Rosario dress to wipe.

""We want people to know how much Karen loved this character, that all the fights and all the boastful and all the attitude were really just she showing her affection - or masking her affection,"" Kohan told The Wrap. This is probably why, before cleaning, Karen gave Rosario a heritage ring that belonged to his mother.

""I want you to have something,"" she said in the show. ""It was my mother's. It is logical that you must have it ... Lord knows that you have been looking at him for years.""

His farewell words? ""Te Amo, Mami.""",1

"He ended up at the center of Kanye West's Twitter drama one day after the rapper published his online text messages.

But that was all the water under the bridge for longtime friends John Legend and Kanye, when they celebrated the Baby Shower of Chrissy Teigen on Friday.

The friends danced on a new Kanye song on the ""Sunken Place"", and even posed together for a photo.

What drama? John Legend and Kanye West put their recent twitter drama behind them as they took a photo and danced together at the Chrissy Teigen Baby Shower

It certainly seemed that John was a fan of the song, while the pair was swinging its head while listening to the other guests of the party.

Kanye also published a video of the singer of ordinary people playing the piano.

""Direct with love,"" legend the video.

The pair seems to have put the twitter drama twitter behind them because they appreciated time with their loved ones.

New blow! It certainly seemed that John was a fan of the song, while the pair was swallowing his head while listening to the other guests at the party

Kanye went to Twitter on Thursday to publish her text messages with John and accused the singer of ""manipulating my free thought"".

In text messages, John urged Kanye to reconsider the alignment with President Donald Trump, after the rapper showed his support for the politician during his long tirade Twitter on Wednesday, even by publishing an online maga hat.

Donald was clearly a fan of Kanye's message, bringing him over and adding: ""Thank you Kanye, very cool!""

Party time: Jesse Tyler Ferguson was among the guests to celebrate Teigen's little boy

""You are far too powerful and influential to approve who he is and what he represents,"" wrote John, who expressed his disgust for the 45th president, in his text message. ""As you know, what you say really means something for your fans.

“They are faithful to you and respect your opinion. So many people who love you feel so betrayed at the moment because they are experiencing the damage that Trump's policies are causing, especially people of color. Do not let it be part of your inheritance. You are the greatest artist of our generation.

Kanye replied: ""I love you John and I appreciate your thoughts. You raise my fans or my inheritance is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.

It did not end there because Kanye displayed the continuation of their conversation while John urged him to: ""Think freely. Also think with empathy and context. Your words and actions have consequences. Lots of love. '

John even had fun in Kanye for having published their private messages on the popular micro-blogging site while he took the opportunity to connect his latest piece entitled to Good Night.

The talented crooner wrote: ""And since you have published SMS, let me add that I have a new single haha"".

No time for the drama: the pair seems to have put the drama weird on Twitter behind them because they loved time with their loved ones

Kanye explained why he had made the decision to publish their text thread to show that there was a controversial but respectful speech between the two.

He said: ""I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me who do not agree with me and express their opinion. I respect everyone's opinion but I hold my field.

Kanye, who also declared in his diatribe Twitter that he was a fan of Hillary Clinton, continued explaining that he wanted to show people that he was empathetic because empathy is not the first thing people think when it comes to a supporter of Trump.

Kanye wrote: ""I really appreciate this dialogue with John Legend because I am in fact very empathetic. I am always the child of the Telethon. I think when people think of Maga, they don't think of empathy.",1

It is therefore understandable that when the model and founder of the Skin Care Kora Organics brand shared its best skin care advice with a vogue teen, including the product it uses to erase its imperfections overnight, we were all ears.

Depending on the model, facial oils are your go-to when faced with a surprise button. ""If I make an escape, I like to balance the pH of my skin with my non-shiny oil. I find that it really helps, even with treating it during the night. I put it after cleaning, mist, exfoliation and hydration,"" she said.

Although we do not debate the effectiveness of the oil on Miranda's skin, we wanted to check with a skin care expert to know if facial oils can work as an effective treatment for the rest of us. And if the advice of the director of research and content of Bryan Barron at the choice of Paula are something to do, it is not good news.

In fact, Barron says: ""While some people report success by using oils to banish outbursts, research mounds have shown that the gently withdrawal of oil and the control of bacteria causing acne with benzoyl peroxide, and the use of an exfoliant without fire with salicylic acid is a proven and reliable approach for acne at all ages.""

In the end, while facial oils are a vital addition in any skin care routine because they do wonders to nourish, plump and hydrate the skin, use them as a pimple treatment may not provide the same results as the proven acne treatment duo of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.

Regarding Heidi, who is married to Spencer Pratt, she said: ""I have drawn up a small list of different products and toys that I liked and sent to him.""

"Chris Pratt and his colleagues Guardians of the Galaxy Stars published an open letter in support of the ousted director James Gunn.

""Although I do not support the inappropriate jokes of James Gunn years ago, he is a good man,"" Pratt wrote in an Instagram message in which he shared a co-signed letter on Monday. ""I would personally like to see him reinstated as director of volume 3. If you want, read the following declaration - signed by our entire cast.""

In the open letter, the casting has referred to a change.org petition asking that Gunn be reinstated. Until now, the petition has attracted more than 330,000 signatures after the dismissal of Disney of Gunn on July 20 after the offensive tweets have resurfaced in which the filmmaker joked on subjects such as pedophilia and rape.

“We fully support James Gunn. We were all shocked by his steep dismissal last week and intentionally expected these ten days to answer in order to think, pray, listen and discuss, ""started the letter, signed by Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Michael Rooker, Sean Gunn and Pom Kalmentieff. ""During this period, we were encouraged by the effusion of the support of fans and media members who wish to see James reintegrated as director of volume 3, as well as discouraged by those who were so easily duped to believe the many theories of the bizarre conspiracy which surround it.""

Gunn's offensive tweets were redone on the surface by conservative personalities, and the Guardians Stars referred to the political division in the United States in the letter.

""There is little regular procedure in the court of public opinion. James is probably not the last good person to be judged. Given the growing political fracture in this country, it is sure to say that cases like this will continue, although we hope that the Americans of all the political spectrum can relieve themselves of the assassinations of character and stop the armament of the mentality of the MOB,"" continued the letter.

By announcing the dismissal of Gunn on July 20, the president of Walt Disney Studios, Alan Horn, said: ""The attitudes and offensive declarations discovered on the James Twitter thread are indefensible and incompatible with the values ​​of our studio, and we have broken our commercial relationship with him.""

Although Disney and Marvel Studios did not set an official release date for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, the film had prepared to shoot in Atlanta this fall, and Gunn had worked on a script. Gunn previously said that the film would open in 2020. Gunn's two Gunn films were great successes for Disney, the original 2014 winning $ 773 million worldwide and the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol of last year. 2 winning $ 863 million.

Before this letter, various casting plans had adopted different approaches to publicly attack the dismissal of Gunn. Bautista, rooker and the brother of the director Sean Gunn had been the most frank in their support for the filmmaker, while Pratt had been more measured, sharing several biblical verses. This is the first statement on the subject of Cooper and Diesel.

"Written on pop culture, media and ethics. Before joining Vox in 2016, they were staff journalists at Daily Dot. 2019 FELLOME of the National Critics Institute, they are considered an authority over the Fandom, Internet and cultural wars.

The last development of the push to express its strength in women and solidarity following the #MeToo movement is in the form of a classic symbol: a white rose.

White has long been associated with the struggle for the equality of women, dating back to the era of suffragettes. Now, Grammy Awards 2018 participants are mobilizing to bring white roses to the ceremony as a means of recognizing the current cultural calculation with harassment and sexual abuses on several industries, including entertainment.

The marketing specialist in the industry Meg Harkins and the promoter Karen Rait had the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, during a dinner where they and other initiates in the music industry thought about means of ensuring that the #MeToo and Time's Up movements were recognized by Grammys, just as they were in Golden Globes.

After choosing the white rose - on which they settled as a symbol of peace, hope and resistance - they began to pass the word through a mass email of the president of the disks of the Atlantic, Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who have confirmed that they will wear white roses with grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper and Rita Ora, among others on a list that would have been in number by hundreds.

Informed of the movement during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the host of Grammys James Corden immediately expressed his support and said that he would also carry one.

Harkins and Rait told Billboard that they were working to coordinate their messages with the Time’s Up campaign leaders, which was generally considered a leveling of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time’s Up also serves as a legal funds for anyone fighting against sexual harassment.

The pressure to prolong the conversation around movement in the grammys is important; So far, despite eminent actors such as Casey Affleck and James Franco who are examined following a wave of allegations of sexual assault in Hollywood, there has been little similar perspective against eminent members of the music industry.

The organizers of the plan to carry white roses to the grammys are too aware of this dichotomy. ""We did not have the tsunami [in the music industry] that politics and Hollywood had,"" Harkins told the Associated Press on Wednesday, ""but we are still women.""

The effort to extend #MeToo and time in the music industry arrives at a time when this last campaign is already drawing a backlash to extend its scope outside of Hollywood, even if it does not even have a month; The campaign was criticized so as not to have been closely focused on Hollywood reform. But the fact that in just a few days, hundreds of women in the music industry have committed to showing solidarity over time in Grammys indicates that many, an expansion of the scope of the movement is always desired by many.

Make sure that the conversation remains galvanized around the Grammys will therefore be an important task for rose carriers. Corden told Hollywood Reporter that the subject will be an important part of the awards ceremony - the most visibly thanks to a significant performance by Kesha intended to highlight the #MeToo movement.

Kesha has become an inadvertent leader in conversations on how to reform the music industry to prevent sexual predators from being structurally protected, due to his long fight to gain the contractual and financial independence of her rapist and former alleged director, the producer of Dr. Luke. His struggle testifies to the continuous need for conversations on abuses and assaults in the music industry as well as the growing call to change.

""We all agreed that it was really necessary,"" said Harkins at the AP. ""We have all felt political and cultural change in the past two months.""",1

"Linkin Park singer, Chester Bennington, has died, confirmed Brian Elias of the Coroner Bureau of the County of Los Angeles to the Hollywood Reporter. He was 41 years old.

The Coroner office said it was on the spot at the singer's home in Palos Verdes Estates investigating suicide. Friday, Ed Winter, spokesperson for the Coroner office, said that Bennington had hanged himself. An autopsy is pending. No delay has been given for the results of the report.

Neither the coroner nor the fire service of the county of Los Angeles could confirm the reports that death was due to the suspension.

The police received an appeal around 9 a.m. by declaring the death, said Elias. Palos Verdes police said it was not clear if the department was going to publish a statement on the issue.

The member of the Linkin Park group, Mike Shinoda, wrote on Twitter: ""Shocked and the heart broken, but that's true. An official statement will be released as soon as we have one.""

Bennington, originally from Phoenix, was open to his difficulties with dependence on drugs and alcohol, which occurred at various times of his life.

The group had just released its seventh studio album, One More Light, and was to embark on a large North American tour this summer and in the fall.

The group was one of the most popular rock groups to emerge in the early 2000s. Their first album Hybrid Theory sold more than 10 million copies in the United States since its release in 2000, by Nielsen Soundscan.

The group won the Grammy Awards in 2001 for the best performances in Hard Rock for ""Crawling"" and again in 2005 for the best rap / sung collaboration for ""Numb / again"".

On May 26, Bennington sang ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen to Los Angeles Memorial Service of the Rocker of Soundgarden Chris Cornell, who died by suicide. A few days earlier, in a note published online, Bennington wrote a tribute to his friend Cornell saying: ""I cannot imagine a world without you. I ask to find peace in the next life.""

""The Cornell family is overwhelmed by the heartbreaking news of Chester Bennington, who comes tragically so shortly after the loss of their family,"" a spokesman for the Cornell family told the Associated Press. ""They open their magnetic weapons to the Chester family and share sorrow with all those who loved it.

"The success of blockbuster this weekend was none other than Girls Trip, a hot comedy in R that follows four friends during a non-stop trip to the Essence festival in New Orleans. While most of the actors (Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Regina Hall) are already Hollywood favorites, it is the star of the film tablecloth, Tiffany Haddish, who has her moment under the spotlight. And for a good reason: as a shameless and sassy Dina, the most adventurous member of the group, Haddish takes girls to a whole new level of hilarity. Here's why she talks about the city.

Michele K. Short

1. This is her first major role - and she killed him.

The actress born in Los Angeles has been working around this time for more than a decade, having landed support roles in television shows, including real Hollywood husbands and the Carmichael program. She drew the attention of the consumer actor Kevin Hart when she appeared alongside Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele in Keanu (2016). Girls Trip is his first major film, giving it the greatest opportunity to shine to date - but you have never trampled on it as a newcomer to its performance. And there are more Haddish is on the way. Make sure you catch your very first special standup, it is ready! From Hood to Hollywood on August 18 at 9 p.m. And on Showtime.

2. His background frame is inspiring.

Haddish had an unconventional path to celebrity, led to the scene by a series of tragedies that took place during his young life. When she was 9 years old, her mother suffered brain damage and subsequent mental illness following a car accident, leaving Haddish the only goalkeeper of her four younger brothers and sisters. ""I was like a mom fully,"" she told Podcast The Breakfast Club in a recent episode. ""I remember that the doctor withdrew me and said, �? She will never be the person she was, and it's time for you to grow up now."" ""Haddish and her brothers and sisters spent several years in the family investment system, and at 15, a social worker gave him the choice between the way to the psychiatric therapy or the comedy camp of the laughter factor. She chose the camp - where she discovered her talent while working with comedians like Dane Cook, Richard Pryor and Charles Fleischer.

3. She is a Groupon Pro.

During the appearance last week on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Haddish told a scandalous story on taking Will Smith and the Co-Star Jada Pinkett-Smith during a Louisiana marsh tour. She reserved the experience via Groupon, whose Megastar couple had never heard.

4. This grapefruit scene.

If you have not heard of ""grapefruit"", you are probably not alone, but it is obviously a real sex technique according to Sexpert Aunt Angel. Haddish demonstrates this controversial act of love in the girls' journey, in what she calls an ""educational scene"", simulating oral sex using a banana and - you guessed it - a grapefruit. Entertainment Weekly sat with the cast to distribute all the dirty details of this video.

5. His refreshing personality.

Haddish has an undeniable star power on the screen and in real life, but it is the fact that she has overcome so much and worked hard for her dreams that makes her so relatable. If the girls' journey is only the beginning of what she is able to do in the dominant current, we look forward to seeing what Haddish then does.",1
"What to know before diving into the cast of Netflix ""Jonbenet""

Show the hide legend legend Look at the trailer for 'casting Jonbenet' Netflix throws a unique overview of the mysterious death of Jonbenet Ramsay in 'Casting Jonbenet'

Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story incorrectly indicated the duration of the documentary. It's an hour and twenty minutes.

Breaking Jonbenétt is not your typical documentary of the real crime of the day. On the contrary, this contrasts with the many programs devoted to wickedness that has been broadcast on CBS, Discovery, Lifetime investigation and Dr. Phil last year.

These aspires to solve this crime of two decades must verify these noble ambitions at the foot of the bed or the armrest of the sofa before devouring the film of one hour and 20 minutes to bypass the disappointment. The last feat of director of Kitty Green (Ukraine is not a brothel and the face of Ukraine: the cast of Oksana Baiul) does not provide puzzle or insight on the reasons why the lifeless body of Jonbenét Ramsey was discovered in December 1996.

Instead of focusing on the friends of the Queen of the Queen of six years, John and Patsy Ramsey, or the investigators, the objective turns to local actors in the Boulder community to appear in limited reconstructions. In addition, unlike its suggested title, the auditions for the role of blonde beauty are only a small fraction of the film.

Confused? Green’s approach is certainly a unique way to look at the case. During 15 months, the filmmakers met the Coloradans and sought their beliefs on crime. The result is a documentary that transmits popular theories on the case as well as biases.

During their auditions, many reveal a link with the incident. The students of a voice teacher knew Jonbénet. A birth of hope for the role of Patsy revealed that his parents had met the Matriarch and the Patriarch of Ramsey ""several times"", because the murder of his brother connected the parents in mourning. Another actor revealed that he was ""effectively (from his girlfriend) alibi"", because she had to be John's successor, therefore, the police thought he had something to win.

The amateur that Espians remember the details of Jonbennét's death, although everyone's speech does not flow from confidence or certainty. They talk about the ransom note, totaling nearly three pages, which was addressed in the documentary series of CBS The case of: Jonbenét Ramsey last September. Their comments are similar to those who could be heard during a brunch with friends discussing the latest episode of the popular podcast my favorite murder.

They mention the duration of the letter discovered by Patsy, as well as the highbrow language used, and the fact that it was written with a pen and paper belonging to the Ramseys, which, even without training, they found it special. A man who spoke of performing in weddings but not an investigation experience said that a kidnapper would generally ask for a rounded amount, not the $ 118,000 specified. It seems that the media, with sensationalized relationships and a surplus of shows surrounding the 20th anniversary of the crime, have all gave us experts.

Likewise, an actress expresses her doubts that a 9 -year -old child - the age of Jonbennét's brother, Burke, at the time of her death - would have the strength inflicting the head injury she suffered. In juxtaposition, the camera then cuts young boys, successfully dividing a watermelon with a flashlight, the weapon that some people believe was used to kill Jonbenét.

Presenting more the strong beliefs, some women freely spit their opinion on Patsy, despite not knowing it directly. ""She was no longer doing the beauty queen thing,"" supposed one. ""She had aged too much and it was her opportunity to relive him through her daughter.""

Those watching the film will quickly understand that his centerpiece is not the premature and cryptic death of a child; Green's focal point is that which has been less frequently discussed. Not turning to stone, but its undulation, the subsequent conversations and attitudes have formed in a family that intrigues a lot, but few people really know.

Would it be easy to release the white joint grip on our convictions, trained using experts, to admit that we will never know what happened to this little girl? Are we so desperate to give meaning to the insane act that we cling to theories even if that means persecuting innocent people? These are just a few questions to ask by looking in Green's mirror.",1

"It turns out that Victoria Beckham was not upset at royal marriage ... she was relieved

If you haven't looked at the royal wedding this weekend, here is what you missed.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married.

The Reverend Michael Curry was a brilliant star and also the breath of fresh air we all needed and that we wanted so much.

She said:

""Quite honestly, it was such a relief not to be extremely pregnant during this royal marriage that it was a joy to be able to choose everything I wanted to wear.""

Trump and sincere speeches on serious subjects, the 29-year-old stand-up was one of the horses in terms of comments on the program organized by Stephen Colbert of the program. Fowler acted as the Night Annoucerer, adding irreverent jokes on the winners of the night and the members of the public between the segments.

And although this is not the first appearance of Fowler on CBS - he plays in the new series of the Superior Donuts network - it was probably his biggest exhibition to this day and many people had a lot to say about the work he made to advance the spectacle and live:

Trend on the display panel

- I want Jermaine Fowler to make the voiceover for my life #emmys - Buzzfeed (@buzzfeed) September 18, 2017

When I hear @jermainefowler, I can't help but smile. So much enthusiasm. #Emmys - Joe Dorvil (@joedorvil) September 18, 2017

According to Entertainment Tonight, Fowler told Kevin Frazer that ""they only hired me to be myself. It is the best job of all time. I have nothing to do but to speak like that. ”

In relation here are all the winners of the 2017 EMMYS

Fowler made noise on Sunday evening by giving the show traditionally Staid a funny makeover, often prohibiting idiot in his work of voiceover when arriving and leaving speeches and shops. Among his best songs:

- After John Lightgow won the prize for best support actor in a dramatic series for his work on the crown and thanked the British statesman he described in the show, Fowler joked with enthusiasm: ""Criez to Winston Churchill!""

- Celebrating Kate McKinnon's victory for an exceptional support actress in a comedy series, Fowler noted that she was ""a musician with multiple talents who can play the guitar, the cello and the piano ... whore!""

- ""This is the first victory of Laura Dern in Emmy in six nominations, obtain it Laura!"" He said that when Laura Dern won the best support actress in a series or a limited film for her work on Big Little Lies.

- Fowler has become particularly excited when Aziz Ansari and Lena Waithe won for the best writing for a comedy series, with Waithe becoming the first black woman to win this award. After sharing this distinction, Fowler simply shouted, ""Lena!""

- When Don King won for the best staging for a series of varieties, Fowler informed us: ""The first job of national realization of Don was on the show of Michael Douglas. My grandmother loved this show.""

- He was also excited for the first victory of the Emmy of Rice Ahmed for the main actor in a series or a limited film, for his role in Hbo’s the Night of. ""He is also known by his alias hip-hop rice mc. And I am also known under my hip-aalias: Jermaine Ahmed.""

Apart from Superior Donuts, Fowler has credits in the program Eric Andre, Bojack Horseman, Family Guy and his own special television special entitled God Em Hell Kid. Fowler's Foundation is in the comedy standing, which explains why he was so comfortable in his role on Sunday (September 17) night.

When you discuss how White CBS has been in the past in a complex interview earlier this year - the title of the play ""Meet Jermaine Fowler, the first range of black sitcom on CBS in a generation"" - Fowler said at the exit: ""I think they had to shake things up. That reflected this.

The same reasoning can be applied for why Fowler was used to infuse the Emmys.

More personally, Fowler is romantically linked to the make -up maker Meagan Hester, who gave birth to the couple's first child - a girl named Thebe - in July.",1

"It even happens to Beyonce.

The challenge with the production of high -tech concerts is that, like all machines, it sometimes works badly. And Saturday evening, when I was stopped by Warsaw of Jay-Z and the ""On The Run II"" tour of Beyonce, a flight stadium which normally allows the singer to hover on the cultivated was stuck at 20 feet in the air, forcing a rather unworthy outing.

The technicians of the scene were forced to make the old school to bring Beyonce back to earth via an ordinary scale. The group ransacked while Beyonce initially seemed to descend via the scale - understandable given its imposing heels - but ultimately capitulated.

In a fans video (H / T Daily Beast), fans can be heard singing the singer's name while we shout in a thick Polish accent, ""you can do it!"" The fan who posted the video wrote: ""Beyoncé's flight stadium broke at the end of the show in Warsaw and she had to descend on a scale. She also gave us a cute little dance!""

"The #MeToo movement broke the silence, pushing the problems of sexual harassment and the lived experiences of so many women, in the foreground of the national conversation. Now it's time to take this conversation at a deeper level, engaging women and men of all generations and horizons. #MeToo, now what? Ask: How did we get here, and how can we start creating a positive and lasting change?

Our five -part series aims to create a space for an authentic and honest dialogue among women and men, promoting feelings of understanding, healing and reconciliation. We will have uncomfortable conversations, reflecting on the times we - as individuals and as a company - have been complacent, as well as the times when we were able to be accomplices.

Beyond sensational titles, #MeToo, now what? Will examine many of the factors that allow sexual harassment to last in the workplace, despite the laws that are supposed to prevent it from occurring. We will examine the popularity of culture, inequalities, discrimination based on sex and breed and class problems, affect the way society considers women. We will also explore how men can be engaged in this discussion, how some men rethink masculinity and, ultimately, how we could start to trace a path to go.

We invite Americans from all walks of life to participate in this critical conversation, using the hashtag #MeTooonpbs. In the show, we will speak to activists, journalists, celebrities, chiefs and leaders of the media, universities, business, advertising, games and service industries.

"Taylor Swift occurred on Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday, November 13, and the video is emotional alone. But one of the employees of the show revealed more details on his performances via a Twitter thread last night, and that will be sobbed. Last night was the first night of Fallon in the program after the death of her mother, Gloria Fallon, on November 4. Fallon paid an emotional tribute to his mother during the show, during which he revealed private things about his relationship with his mother who make the performance of Taylor Swift Tonight Show even more than a tearful. In his mother's memorial in the show, Fallon said through tears,

When we were little, my mother took us to the store - me and my sister - and we knew our hands. And she hugged my hand three times and said: ""I love you"". And I pressed myself: ""I love you too"". And last week, I was in the hospital, and I just grabbed her hand and I hugged: ""I love you"". I just knew we were in trouble.

It was a moving moment. When Swift occurred later in the show, she seated the piano and sang ""The New Year"", which is the last song of the reputation and one of the most emotional of the album. It is a romantic song with lines like: ""Wait for memories, they will keep you"" and ""do not read the last page, but I stay when it is difficult, or it's bad, or we make mistakes."" But the most emotional moment of this performance came when Swift sang the words of the ""New Year"" who say: ""You shake my hand three times at the back of the taxi."" After hearing Fallon's story on his mother shake hands three times, there was no dry ocular drought in the house when this coincidence occurred.

After the performance of Swift, one of the writers and producers of Tonight Show, Mike Dicenzo, tweeted his thread revealing that Swift agreed to play this night completely at the last minute of an act of kindness for Fallon.

In a series of tweets, Dipenzo said,

I am sure that today was particularly difficult for Jimmy. The fact that he came out, was held there and made a normal monologue for the crowd is a testimony of his strength.

But in the office, you could hear his voice breaking by talking about our musical guest Taylor Swift, and it was because he knew what he was going to say ...

Jimmy's words on his mother were beautiful. ""Mom, I will never stop trying to make you laugh. I love you."" I was crying. We were all.

The story of his mother shakes hands 3 times to say ""I love you"" when he was a child, then shake his hand in the hospital - he had told any of us this story ... More about it in a second.

First, a quick word on Taylor Swift. She was not planned to make our program today. But we wanted something special for this first show, so we asked her a full whim because she was in town to make SNL. She said yes without hesitation.

She sang the ""New Year's Day"". No one had heard it. Suddenly, she sings the line, ""shakes my hand 3 times at the back of the taxi."" I have almost dropped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience began to sob.

I could see Jimmy Silhouetted at his office standing my eyes with a fabric. We all lost it. It was a great coincidence in a good performance. ""Wait for your memories, they will keep you,"" sung Taylor.

This hug between Jimmy and Taylor after the song was 100% real emotion. Whatever you think of Taylor, she did something beautiful for Jimmy and our show today, and we are still grateful.

It was a moving performance, and the fans loved it.

Swift was in New York last weekend as a musical guest of Saturday Night Live organized by Tiffany Haddish, where she played ""... Ready for It?"" And ""Call that you want."" The end of The Tonight Show showed that Fallon crossed the crowd giving High Fives to members of the public who, according to Dipenzo, were added because it was Gloria Fallon's favorite part of each episode.",1

"A series of unfortunate events have a large number of bad guys and enemies hiding, but no more threatening or inventive than Count Olaf. As terrible a man as an actor, Count Olaf spends the series of books of Lemony Snickket in pursuit of the orphans of Baudelaire in the hope of obtaining their massive fortune. In the adaptation of Netflix, the amateur threatening Thespian is described by the charming master Thespian Neil Patrick Harris, but it sometimes seems that Count Olaf is not the only role he plays. How many characters is Neil Patrick Harris in a series of unfortunate events?

Technically, Harris only plays the role of Count Olaf in the series. However, Count Olaf himself depicts a certain number of characters, all in order to get closer to the orphans of Baudelaire and get their hands on their immense wealth. The first season of a series of unhappy events follows orphans as sent to four different caregivers, during which they meet many different characters that Olaf depicts and generally catches his legion of labor also disguising in various roles.

Harris takes the opportunity to play several roles with a stellar effect, depicting the often ridiculous caricatures that Count Olaf thinks. Here is an overview of the many faces of Count Olaf in season 1 of an unhappy series of events. Beware, because there is a minor a series of unhappy event spoilers for the book and the television program below.

Count Olaf

Joe Lederer / Netflix

Presented in the bad beginning of the horrible history of Snickket of the Baudelaire orphans, Count Olaf does not waste time establishing how bad and cruel it is. He finds pleasure in the pain of others, lives in a dilapidated house with garbage everywhere and sets up singing and dance numbers developed with his troop of misdeeds. Olaf's wickedness is still improved by Harris's performance, taking care to state each contemptible word that escapes his mouth.

A brand new disguise

Joe Lederer / Netflix

Without giving too much, Count Olaf quickly watches an outfit for an alter-ego consultant exclusive to the Netflix series. Here, the character speaks with Mr. Poe, the executive of the deceased succession of Baudelaire's parents. Fortunately, in the future, Olaf is sure to improve its costume skills in a major way.

Stefano

Joe Lederer / Netflix

Stefano is Olaf's first major disguise, and removing his emblematic hair and putting on a massive beard with an Italian accent does wonders. Olaf manages to deceive almost everyone, but the Baudelars, who are confronted with the vaguely eccentric duty to convince adults in their lives that Stefano is, in fact, Count Olaf.

Captain Sham

Joe Lederer / Netflix

When the orphans of Baudelaire are sent to live on the shore of Lake Lachrymose, Count Olaf infiltrates their lives by becoming the accidental captain - a man whose knowledge of the salty sea is almost as vast as his burns.

Shirley

Joe Lederer / Netflix

Olaf's final costume of season 1 sees him playing the role of Shirley, secretary of the optometrist, Dr. Orwell. The Harris turn, because Olaf-As-Shirley is not the first time that Harris played with the genre for a role, when he played the role of Tony, the singer of Genderqueer Hedwig in Hedwig and The Angry Inch. With this experience behind him, he is sure to say that NPH had no problem walking in Shirley's heels.

If the show continues to follow the original series of unhappy event books in season 2, Olaf will continue to build many disguises and personalities in order to rid the orphans of Baudelaire of their fortune. Harris is more than the challenge of playing any role and stretching his already considerable talents to fully sum up the many different versions of this nasty character.",1
"It can be a shock, but there is a ton of celebrities that have the same last name, but are not really linked!

Camila Mendes previously went to social networks to clarify that she is her own person and is not a dedicated account in Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello.

""Just a Camila Mendeshindal in front of the Twitterverse who ceased to think that she is a fans account for Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes,"" she tweeted in February 2017.

The Riverdale star later said that she did not understand how fans could confuse his social media account with the couple, who began to go out years later in 2019.

Although Camila is not close to her homonym, Joey King previously noted that she was in great terms with Jaime King, even if they are not linked.

And Ross Lynch? He has the same surname as Harry Potter Evanna Lynch's star - but no, they are not the brothers and sisters either.

"Royal offspring of Queen Victoria and Christian IX from Denmark

The royal descendants of Queen Victoria (May 24, 1819-January 22, 1901; r. 1837-1901) and King Christian IX (April 8, 1818-January 29, 1906; r. 1863-1906), the monarchs of the United Kingdom and Denmark, became members of several European royal families. This was partially achieved by the marriage of Victoria's offspring with Christian (and vice versa). At the time of her diamond jubilee in 1897, Victoria was known as the ""grandmother of Europe"". [1] Christian IX was nicknamed the ""European stepfather"". [2]

The grandchildren of Victoria and Christian were the monarchs of Denmark, Germany / Prussia, Greece, Norway, Russia and the United Kingdom. Today, the descendants of Victoria and Christian domination over Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Grandchildren [edit]

Christian IX in 1898 with his Mutual great-frills and Queen Victoria Prince Edward of York, later Edward VIII [A]

Victoria organized the marriage of her son and older heir, the future King Edward VII, with Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the daughter of Christian IX, who took place on March 10, 1863. Among the six children of Edward and Alexandra were King George V and his sister Maud. [1] Maud would later marry his cousin, the future King Haakon VII of Norway, in 1896. [B] [8]

Son of Christian and brother of Alexandra, Prince William, became king of Hellenes like George I in 1863 because of his link with the British royal family. [9] On October 27, 1889, the son of George, later Constantine I of Greece, married Princess Sophia of Prussia. [C] [9]

Another daughter of Christian IX, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, married the future Emperor Alexander III of Russia [11] in October 1866, [12] taking the religious name Maria Feodorovna. [11] Between 1881 and 1894, Maria's husband reigned as sovereign of Russia. [12] Her son, Nicholas II, became an emperor of Russia to the death of Alexander III. [11] Nicholas married Princess Alix de Hesse and by Le Rhin, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, November 26, 1894, and Alix became his wife, adopting the name of Alexandra Feodorovna. [11]

Other grandchildren from one or two of Victoria and Christian were sovereigns suo swear or consorts of sovereigns, in particular:

The First World War [edit]

At the start of the First World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, six major powers in Europe were divided between two coalitions. On the one hand, France, Russia and the United Kingdom have formed triple understanding. On the other hand, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy have formed the triple alliance. [18] During this conflict, George V was the king of the United Kingdom. [1] Moreover, during the First World War, Nicholas II was emperor of Russia, [19] and Wilhelm II was the German emperor [20]

Historian Margaret Macmillan noticed the close link between George, Nicholas and Wilhelm. Namely, George's father and Wilhelm's mother were brothers and sisters, making George and Wilhelm the German cousins. In addition, George's mother and Nicholas' mother were sisters of the Danish royal family, making George and Nicholas the cousins. [F] [23]

Descendants later [edit]

There are seven current riding monarchs in Europe which descends from Victoria or Christian IX or both. In 2004, on Tatoi Palace tour and the Royal Greek cemetery, Queen Anne -Marie de Greece commented on the relations of the Royals, ""so you see, everyone comes on two sides - Denmark, King Christian IX and Great Britain, Queen Victoria - and they are all sides of Criss, I mean too!"" Anne-Marie is a descendant of Victoria and Christian IX, just like her husband, Constantine II of Greece. [24]

"(Warning: This message contains spoilers for the mid-season final of season 3 of ""This is us"", entitled ""The start is the end is the start"")

""This is us"" closed the first half of his third season Tuesday evening by abandoning several bombs on the public - and please apologize, because no game of war words were planned.

It's just that the drama of the Pearsons arrived hard and fast in the last moments of the episode, entitled ""The beginning is the end of the beginning"", with the biggest shock for the systems of the fans this evening being the revelation that Jack Pearson's little brother was not dead in the Vietnam War.

Throughout the last episode of the NBC series created by Dan Fogelman, we see Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) trying, once again, to go to Nicky (Michael Angarano) after the first brought the last to his camp to Vietnam to try to put him in the right and close and to pass him the rest of the time they left to serve.

Nicky relapses and Jack swears that he will clean his brother again. And as we pay the end of the hour, we do not know what will happen to the young man of Pearson - especially since there are only 48 to spend together.

We have reduced to our days, when Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his girlfriend Zoe (Melanie Liburd) plunged into his father and the past (supposedly late) of the uncle in the small village of Vietnam where Jack was stationed.

There is a strong explosion and Jack will run to find Nicky, with one of the soldiers noting that ""a boat exploded. I think that one of our guys was on this."" Jack plunges into the water and starts swimming towards a scene that we cannot see.

We return to Kevin in the present, where the translator who helped him communicate with a local historian, mentions with casualness that he was going to suggest something that Kevin could bring back to the house to lie on the war memorial of his uncle one day - but then he discovered that his uncle was not dead.

""None of your family died in the war,"" he said, telling him that he had checked the commemorative war database, the name of Nicholas Pearsons is not there. He was not dead in Vietnam - at least not in war anyway.

Then we cut inside a trailer, where a man - played by Griffin Dunne - takes off his coat. The camera focuses on a piece of mail which is addressed to ""Nicholas Pearson"" and sent to his residence in Bradford, Pennsylvania.

Yes, Nicky is very alive - and when the show will return next year, it will be played today by Dunne.

And, we bet, Kevin will probably come and pick him up.

""This is us"" will return on January 15 to NBC.",1

"Golden Globes 2018 Review: Seth Meyers, Oprah Winfrey a frappé toutes les bonnes notes

Displaying the hide legend legend listen to the power of Oprah Winfrey Golden Globes, Oprah Winfrey's speech has obtained several ovations standing for his speech to accept Golden Globes on women, equality, sexual harassment and more. Elle a été honorée du prix Cecil B. DeMille pour réalisation à vie. USA today

Ce serait toujours un autre type de récompenses.

How could the first prices since Hollywood have been shaken at his heart by a series of allegations of sexual harassment, assault and misconduct - be as usual? It was different from the red carpet, where the candidates and others wore black as a symbol of protest and solidarity with the victims of harassment. Alors, comment suivez-vous cela avec un monologue?

L'animateur Seth Meyers, au moins, l'avait surtout compris.

The NBC late evening host went on stage for the first time during the traditionally cowardly and watered award ceremony, launching a season of awards in the middle of a cultural upheaval. It is not exactly a task that comes with a game book, as he noted with playful when he shouted to ""hosts of other awards to come who look at me as the first dog in space"".

Plus: vivre des Golden Globes 2018

Si les autres hôtes étaient nerveux pour Meyers, ils n'auraient pas dû l'être. The actor managed to find the good tone for his fast opening monologue, which easily moved between the smart (and appropriate) jokes on the allegations of sexual harassment with the usual jokes on the harvest of candidates of the year to a frequent recipient of his beards, President Trump.

After starting with a ""good evening measured and remaining gentlemen"", Meyers approached the allegations head -on, rather than folding around the subject. Some of the jokes have not landed completely, including a criticism Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct and assault, for his house of Southern Accent, but Meyers was able to recover. ""Était-ce trop méchant? To Kevin Spacey?""

The host also judiciously brought a segment of the end of the night "", the Seth jokes cannot say it"" at the ceremony, well suited to a night when women made a big statement on the red carpet. Instead of giving two women writers from her show as usual, Meyers gave Mike to a variety of women in the public, including Issa Rae d'In insecure and the former host of the Globes Amy Poehler, who took the opportunity to rib her former distribution companion of Saturday Night Live.

Si Meyers a trouvé un bon équilibre, le reste du spectacle semblait un peu plus grossier. Some winners, including Big Little Lies, features Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern, referred to the #MeToo movement in their acceptance speeches. Pour d'autres, c'était comme d'habitude, en remerciant d'autres candidats, familles et gestionnaires. And some on stage at the Beverly Hilton were simply strange, like when James Franco - after winning for the best actor in a musical or comedy for the disaster artist - brought the original director of the sad film The Room, Tommy Wiseau, on stage with him. (La catastrophe concerne la réalisation de ce film).

But at the eleventh hour (well, about two hours later), Oprah Winfrey went on stage to inject a meaning and a real emotion in an exciting acceptance speech for the Cecil B. Demille price that brought the house. After recognizing how prices can offer powerful representation to marginalized communities, Winfrey transformed the majority of his speech to the #MeToo movement.

""For too long, women have not been heard or raw if they dared to tell their truth in the power of these men. But their time has passed. Their time has passed!"" Elle a dit.

Dans un moment culturel aussi lourd que celui-ci, une remise de prix ne peut pas être tout pour tout le monde. Mais en tant qu'hôte, Meyers a fait de son mieux pour le faire fonctionner, avec l'aide des gagnants. Her performance was not perfect, but she set a high bar for the rest of the reward season and the host of repeated Oscars Jimmy Kimmel.

Meyers a promu les Globes en disant qu'Hollywood avait beaucoup à dire. Il a définitivement commencé la conversation.

"I CAME TO WASHINGTON TO FIGHT FOR A SMALLER GOVERNMENT AND GET Spending Under Control, Not Shut The Government Down. In fact, I have repeatedly vote to fund the government in the last few days.

The Shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. The MacDill Air Force base in Tampa experienced more than 1,500 employees, endangering our national security in danger before the defense secretary Chuck Hagel sends them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing has possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus Growers Can't Access the E-Verify System to Ensure Work Autorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.

Unfortunately, President Barack Obama and the head of the majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, were unreasonable and do not want to negotiate, which led to this closure of the government. We can end this if they would Join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and Our President Won't budget.

I want to be clear: i have never supported obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went further and I introduced an amendment to the continuous resolution which would guarantee that the complete extent of Obamacare applies to members of the Congress, the President, the Vice-President and the Staff. The House Passed My Amendment With Bipartisan Support. UNFORTUNATELY, The Democratic-Controlled Senate has passed any of these bills and refused to this voting on my amendment. We are Badly Mistaken to Think there is any hop of the President Eliminatting His Signature Legislation, as awness as it is.

Shutting Down the Government Has Had Zero Impact on Obamacare. Unfortanely, some were led to Believe that Obamacare WOULD IMMIDATELY CEASE IF The Government Shut Down. However, the reality is that, despite the government's closure for several days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all its problems and problems. In fact, around 70% of Obamacare is funded by compulsory financing while the current financing battle deals only with discretionary financing - it does not even affect compulsory financing.

Since its big opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been abject failure. Innumerable technical seeds have prevented registrants from accessing online exchanges, and there are infinite shock reports of stickers to consumers of the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that obamacare is a disaster. However, these failures and many others were overshadowed by the government's closure and the debate on a continuous resolution which, according to the law, has never completely funded Obamacare.

Obamacare Will Fall Under Its Own Weight of Complexies, Costs and Inconsencies, All at the Expense of the American People. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, to highlight its impact, to gain control of the Senate and to elect a president who will support his repeal.

"In one of the surprises of the morning, Debra Messing received an appointment to the Golden Globe in the best television comedy / musical actress for ""Will & Grace"" on Thursday. Excellent news for her, but if she does not win next month, it would extend the disc of the lamentant globes of the show at 0-30.

Although it is one of the three shows where the main stars have all won the Emmy Awards, the NBC comedy is the biggest television loser in the Globes. ""Will & Grace"" amassed 27 nominations and zero victories during the first time from 1998 to 2006. Last year, he added two other nominations, for the best television / musical series series and the best actor of comedy / television comedy for Eric McCormack, to carry his album to 0-29. On their credit, the stars had a good sense of humor on this subject, often toasted on the globes when their names were not announced.

See Golden Globes 2019: Complete list of appointments

Messing received six nominations during the comedy's original race (she also has two nominations for ""The Starter Wife""). She should not obtain an appointment this year, sitting in ninth place in our predictions. But the disorder received elegant criticism last month for its powerful performance in the ""Will & Grace"" episode, in which Grace (Messing) revealed to his father Martin (Robert Klein) that her late friend had sexually assaulted him when she was a teenager.

It will finally be the year of ""Will & Grace""? The appointment of Messing was the only one for the series, and she faces two people, Kristen Bell (""The Good Place"") and Rachel Brosnahan (""The wonderful Mme Maisel""), whose programs are nominated for the first prize, the latter being the reigning champion. His other rivals are the nominated return Alison Brie (""Glow"") and another actress in a revival, Candice Bergen (""Murphy Brown""), who won in 1989 and 1992 for the original.

Chmerkovskiy shared his feelings in another tweet: ""I can't wait to make you my wife.""

"Actor Sterling K. Brown has become a familiar name in recent years thanks to his work in high -level projects like ""This is us"", ""The People c. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story ""and"" Black Panther "".

But to hear the 41 -year -old star talking about her 10 -year wedding with her colleague Ryan Michelle Bathhe, you realize that he has also been lucky for a long time.

Here are seven things you may not know about this adorable couple.

1. They met at university

Bathhe and Brown were both the same year in Stanford, and even lived in the same dormitory as first -year students, according to Stanford Daily! They were also friends who performed in campus productions before starting to go out together.

When they knew each other in college, they discovered that they were both from St. Louis, Missouri, and were even born in the same hospital. Small world! The couple continued their higher education at New York University.

2. It was difficult to get

According to what Brown said ""The Talk"", he and Bathhe ""came out from time to time"" for a certain time before breaking for more than three years at one point. When Brown decided to finally try to reconquer her, he did things, including the pursuit after her while she was jogging so that he could convince her that she was the love of her life.

3. They have two cute children

Like his character, Randall Pearson, of ""This is us"" from NBC, Brown has two children with his college wife. But, instead of two girls, they have two boys: Andrew, 6 and Amare, 2 years old. Bathhe and Brown shared pretty stories about their sons, such as Andrew wants to be a scientist and has a whole personality. Discover its movements below in a brown video shared on Instagram!

4. She gave birth at home

According to Brown, when Andrew came, Bathhe had such a quick job that she ended up giving birth at home, with him helping to deliver their son. They told the story on the red carpet at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards and it's quite hilarious.

5. They both love their work

Brown is perhaps the star of the break of ""This is us"", but Bathhe also played a recurring role in the successful show. During the first season, she played Yvette, a black woman who appeared for the first time in a memorable flashback scene at the public swimming pool, advising the adoptive mother of Randall Rebecca on how to take care of her hair.

It was not the first time that the couple had appeared on the screen together. Brown played the only male military spouse among the main actors in the ""army wives"" in Lifetime. And, in the sixth season of the show, Bathhe played the partner of a soldier in active service. They also appeared together in an episode of ""Harry’s Law"". However, the two apparently avoid rehearsals, as they said to E!.

""We have learned that there are certain minefields and traps in our relationship which, like a slalom, are right next to them,"" said Bathhe to the network in 2017. ""And repeating together is one of these things.""

6. They laugh a lot

Brown told petrol that their wedding key is that he and will constantly bathe! ""Brown is apparently a fairly funny guy when he doesn't make us cry ... which is fundamentally all the time.

7. They surround themselves with support

Brown told ABC News that his key for his marriage that they had a community of people around them who support him and bathe. ""One thing I learned so that any relationship succeeds is the people who are part of your life, they must defend your union,"" he said. ""Not just you, not just her. They must defend you all.""

8. They clearly admire each other

Brown says the softest things about Bathhe in his price acceptance speeches. For example, during the Screen Actors Guild Awards 2018, he delivered a speech where he said: ""I love the actors so much, I decided to marry one. Ryan Michelle Bathhe, you are the best stage partner that a brother has ever had.""

And when he was noisily played on the Emmy 2017 stage before finishing his speech, he made sure that he thanked Bathhe behind the scenes.

And Bathhe seems that she could not be proud of Brown's achievements.

So, put the bath and brown up there with couples of celebrities who make marriage quite good.",1

"Latavia Roberson may have been expelled from Destiny’s Child - but she is still a ""survivor"".

""There are a lot of things I have experienced - sexual assaults, alcohol and drug treaters,"" Dress told people exclusively of the subjects she will approach in her next memories, I am Latavia, because of spring 2017.

And there is of course a subject from which she will not go away: her unpleasant disagreement of one of the largest groups of girls of all time in 1999.

Roberson was an original member of Destiny’s Child, with Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Letoya Luckett. The group succeeded with their eponymous album in 1997, but really broke out in 1999 with The Writing’s on the Wall, which included the successful singles ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", ""Jumpin"", Jumpin '""and"" Say My Name "".

""We were patient, we worked very hard and hear our belongings on the radio?"" We prayed together for the success of the group, and when we started to hear the songs on the radio, we started to tour, we really saw people liked Destiny’s Child. ""

But in 2000, everything stopped for Roberson.

""I have never left Destiny’s Child. This is something that people say. But who would leave Destiny’s Child? It's crazy! I was fired from the group,"" she said. ""It was very difficult because of the way I discovered it. I even hate to talk about it, and that is 20 years - but that's what it is. We saw the video"" Say My Name ""on television, and that's how I discovered that I was no longer in the group.""

Indeed, Roberson and Luckett did not appear in the video but were replaced by the new arrivals Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. (Franklin would leave the group after only months.)

""It was very difficult. I am almost sure it was difficult for all of us - because we were young,"" said Dress. “My problem has always been with management; It was never with girls. ”

Despite this, Roberson admits having been ousted from the group that wreaked havoc on it.

""It was almost like a bad divorce-you are no longer with your friends, people you love so much. So it was difficult in itself,"" she adds. ""And then be alone at that time, when other aspects start to take me. It led me in a depression. And it was not pretty, like at all.""

Despite this, Roberson would continue to win two grammys for her work on the second album of Destiny’s Child and finally made a foray into television, appearing on TV One’s R&B Divas: Atlanta. And in recent years, Roberson has played the real role of the mother, welcoming the daughter Lyric in 2013.

But does the former star of the girl group have a semblance of a relationship with his unique group comrades?

""I do it. It is not as if we were talking all the time, but I was chatting with LeToya the day before yesterday. I spoke to Kelly, and I saw Beyoncé; it's been years ago, but there was only love,"" explains Roberson, who even made peace with the women who replaced her in the group. ""I had the opportunity to meet Michelle, I met Farrah and, once again, it was nothing other than love.""

And Roberson maintains that she is a fan of the music of her childhood friends.

To find out more about Latavia Roberson, take the latest issue of People, on newsstands on Friday.

""Everyone has their life, but I know with regard to the fact that I, an original member with the girls with whom I started all their careers, and their music guided me a lot. It was wonderful,"" she said, adding that the lemonade of Beyoncé and Solange Knowles ""acclaimed by the criticism of a siege at the table were two special favorites this year.

In the end, the new author says that there is no bad blood.

""I believe that nothing in life has happened in vain. I believe that things happen for a reason, and there is only love on my side.""",1
"New York - The planned mosque and the blocks of the Islamic Center of Ground Zero obtained a new boost on Wednesday from a coalition of supporters who includes families of the victims of September 11.

New York neighbors for American values ​​rallied for the first time in a municipal building near Ground Zero.

""I lost a 23 -year -old son, a paramedical ambulancer who gave his life Americans and their values,"" said Talat Hamdani, and supporting the Islamic center and the mosque ""has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with our human rights, including freedom of religion.""

Among the nearly 2,800 people killed when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001, there were more than 30 Muslims, she noted.

Opponents of the Islamic Center project argue that it is insensitive to families and memories of the victims of September 11 to build a mosque so close. Supporters cite freedom of religion.

The new coalition was launched by members of 40 civic and religious organizations which ""were spontaneously called, because we had the feeling that something very negative was happening,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the New York Office of the Common Cause surveillance group.

Controversy was triggered by ""irresponsible politicians"" using it as an electoral problem, she said. The names mentioned during the rally included the former president of the Newt Gingrich Chamber, a Republican, and the largest deralers in the Senate, the head of the majority Harry Reid.

Gingrich suggested that the construction of the mosque near Ground Zero is like putting a Nazi sign ""next to the Holocaust Museum"". Reid has broken the ranks with President Barack Obama saying he thinks the mosque should be built elsewhere.

The members of the coalition now contact civil servants, asking them to support the project as the reflection of religious freedom and diversity, and the rejection of ""raw stereotypes intended to frighten and divide us"".

They plan a candle vigil near Ground Zero on September 10, the day before the ninth anniversary of September 11.

""It is not only a question of Muslims; they are who we are as Impréricans,"" said Lerner, adding that to oppose the Islamic center is ""a slippery slope. There will always be offended people standing next to people who are different from others"".

Rabbi Arthur Waskow, director of New York Shalom Center, said the project will show the world a form of Islam that marries peace - not the Islam of the terrorists.

""It is true; it is wise to build it,"" he told hundreds of people gathered under the arches of the municipal building in Manhattan, a few steps from Ground Zero.

Several members of the coalition noted that the developer of the Mosque site, Sharif El-Gamal, modeled it after the Jewish community center of the Upper West Side in Manhattan. He serves anyone who wishes to participate, they said, like the Muslim center near Ground Zero.",1
